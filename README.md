# Machine Learning Expert
Machine Learning Repository.
I am a machine learning expert. I am especially motivated  on developing algorithms which can 'learn'  or adopt to data  and make predictions. 
In the course of my studies, I have often made predictions in market shares,disease outcomes and the most recent one which am in course of doing; making predictions on weather patterns which has significant effect on global warming. I am especially motivated to carry out this research and come up with a viable solution that is able to help communities at large in the fight against climate change.
Furthemore, I am also proefficient in python libraries like matplotlib in enhancing data visualization
